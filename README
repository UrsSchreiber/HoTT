This directory contains material in the context of 
homotopy type theory

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+type+theory ,

the internal language of infinity-toposes

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/(infinity,1)-topos .

The directory "Hott/Coq" contains Coq code

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Coq

for Martin-Löf type theory

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/Martin-Löf+type+theory .

that sets up the basic notions of homotopy type theory.

The subdirectory "HoTT/Coq/HIT" contains code that sets up
higher inductive types

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/higher+inductive+types.

The subdirectory "HoTT/Coq/Cohesion" contains code that
sets up the internal language of cohesive infinity-toposes

  http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+(infinity,1)-topos .

You can fork this repository to your own and then be automatically
kept up to date on new developments. You can also contribute back into
it by sending a pull request.

The Coq files contain fancy UTF-8 characters. To input these you have
to set up an appropriate input method, see

  http://coq.inria.fr/cocorico/TeXInputMethodForUnicodeNotations

for help on doing so with Emacs and CoqIDE.
